<h1>Translate bare stats from Battlescribe to Rosterizer format</h1>
<h3>BEWARE: Battlescribe format is very opinionated about how things should be structured. Rosterizer allows much more freedom in its data architecture.</h3>
<p>
  This means that the output of this tool may not fit the needs of its game system well, and will most likely need to be adjusted. <em>(but at least all the stats and assets are pre-generated!)</em>
